## Overview
This is just an example repository to show how the repo should look if you want to include additional prebuilts into the RattlesnakeOS build process. <b>This will not build in it's current form as it just has a dummy APK file.</b>

## General Structure
Each additional app you want to include should be in a subdirectory and include both the APK and Android.mk file required to include it into the build tree.
